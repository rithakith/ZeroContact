MANUAL FIX FOR GROUND COLLISION
===============================

Since the Tools menu items aren't showing, here's how to fix it manually:

1. FIND THE GROUND
   - In Hierarchy window, search for "DemoGround"
   - If it doesn't exist, create it:
     * Create Empty GameObject
     * Name it "DemoGround"
     * Set Position: X=-5, Y=-2, Z=0

2. FIX THE COLLIDER
   - Select DemoGround
   - In Inspector, look for components
   - If you see "Box Collider" or "Mesh Collider", click the gear icon → Remove Component
   - Click "Add Component" button
   - Type "Box Collider 2D" 
   - Select "Box Collider 2D" (under Physics 2D)

3. MAKE IT VISIBLE (Optional)
   - Add Component → Rendering → Sprite Renderer
   - In Sprite field, click the circle and select any sprite (like "UISprite" or "Knob")
   - Set Color to dark gray
   - Set Scale: X=8, Y=0.5, Z=1

4. CHECK PLAYER PREFAB
   - Find your Player prefab in Project
   - Make sure it has:
     * Rigidbody2D (Gravity Scale = 1 or 2)
     * BoxCollider2D or CapsuleCollider2D
     * Both should NOT have "Is Trigger" checked

5. MOVE SPAWN POINT (if player still falls too far)
   - Find "PlayerDemoSpawn" in Hierarchy
   - Change Y position from 0 to -1

COMMON ISSUES:
- 3D collider on ground (won't work with 2D player)
- No collider on ground
- Player has 3D collider instead of 2D
- Spawn point too high above ground

After these changes, save the scene and test!
