# 🛡️ Contactless

A strategic shield-based action game where **touch is lethal** and survival means staying completely out of contact. Designed around the core idea of **zero physical interaction**, *Contactless* challenges players to adapt, react, and defend using dynamic shields and enemy-type counterplay mechanics.


## 🎮 Game Overview

**Contactless** is a game where contact equals damage — even the slightest brush can be fatal. You can't attack directly. Instead, you manipulate shield types that change based on enemy attacks, using smart movement, timing, and tactical decisions to survive and progress.


## 💡 Core Mechanics

- **Zero Contact Combat**  
  Touch = Damage. All enemies and hazards must be avoided or countered without physical contact.

- **Reactive Shield System**  
  Your shield automatically adapts to enemy attack types (e.g., energy, fire, brute force), providing resistance — but only if timed correctly.

- **Emotionally Driven Themes**  
  The game explores the feeling of isolation, distance, and over-reliance on defense — both physical and emotional.
